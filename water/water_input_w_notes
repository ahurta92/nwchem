{All inputs up to this point affects only the settings in the runtime database}
{the program takes its infomration from this database, so the sequence of directives up to the first TASK directive is irrelavant.  An exhange of order of the different blocks or directivs would not effect the result. }
{The task directive must be specified after all relevant input for a given problem.  }
{The TASK directive casues the code to perform the specified calculations using the parameters set in the preceding directives}
{The fist task is a SCF calculation with geometry optimaztion specified with the input and scf optimize}
