Water Molecule Sample Input

-Optimzation of a positively charged water molecule using second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2)
-Computation of frequencies at optimized geometry

Preliminary SCF geometry optimization is performed (Hartree Fock) using STO-3G basis
    - good starting guess of the optimal geometry,
    - Hessian information generated will be used in the next optimization step
    - optimization is finished using MP2 and  a basis set with (polarization funcitons)
    - Compute MP2 vibrational frequencies
