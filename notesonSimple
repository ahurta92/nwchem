Simpleinput.nz is an example input file
It is a Self Consistent Field geometry optimazation of Nitrogen Molecule
N2, using a Dunning cc-pvdz basis set

contains 4 directives 
1. title: optional, provides means of easily identifying outputs from jobs
2. Geometry: provides intial geometry in cartesian coordinates/angstroms 
3. basis: The Dunning cc-pvdz basis is obtained from NWChem basis library
4. task: tells the program to optimize the molecular geometry by minimizing the SCF energy
